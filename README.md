## Description
This project renders two paragraphs:
* Information about who created this project
* Copyright with the current year

## Notes
JSX allow us to insert HTML into JS Files      
We can also insert JS inside out HTML that is already inside our JS file (eg: myName variable)     
The curly braces { } will pass myName variable as JS instead as HTML string       
We can inject JS Expressions but we can NOT write JS Statements    

## What I have learned with this project:
* Create constants
* Retrieve the current year using Date, a JavaScript Object
* Insert HTML elements inside our JS files to be render 
* Insert JS Variables inside the Html Elements created
